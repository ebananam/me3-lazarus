**NOTE #1: Currently only supports PC and FemShep.**

**NOTE #2: Backup all your saves before using this :P**

Normal use should look something like this:
  1. Start
  1. Open ME2 save
  1. Open ME3 save (should be the same character of ME2)
  1. Edit mapping (skippable)
  1. Save modified ME3 save (will be saved on same folder as in 3. as "Save\_1000.pcsav")
  1. Switch to game, load Save\_1000 and see results
  1. Repeat 4-6 as needed
  1. Exit

Mapping is stored on the executable directory as "lod\_mapping.xml".
To start with a fresh map, simply delete the file and restart editor.

By default the OffsetBones will also be carried from ME2 to ME3, but it can be deactivated by using the related checkbox.

**In the shortcuts above there is mentioning of an IGNORE function. This was originally used to skip certain vertices during the adjustment, but the current release will only adjust vertices that have been marked as VERIFIED, thus the IGNORE option is now used simply as a color tag for better visualization.**
