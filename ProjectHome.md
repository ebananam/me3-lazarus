This project is meant to provide part of a solution to ME3 current import bug (face geometry).

It provides a visual editor to map each individual ME2 vertex into 1 or more ME3 vertices and then uses this mapping to create an adjusted ME3 save.

Other projects such as texmod are needed to handle the remaining assets, such as face textures and hairstyles.

Uses gibbed's libraries for save file handling.
